I chose C++ as the language for this hypothetical situation. I have recently done development with C++, but very little any CI/CD things with it, so I thought that this would be quite an interesting topic to investigate.

For linting purposes there seems to exist multiple different solutions. First of all, as generally the majority of C++ development happens in Visual Studio IDE, looking into its offerings is an obvious choice. VS has built in IntelliSense system, which does syntax highlighting amongst other things, but nowadays also linting. Alternatively, one quite popular linter tool for C++ seems to be the clang-based Clang-Tidy. Next, for testing purposes the GoogleTest framework seems to be the most established go-to testing system for C++. Also, Catch is quite simple but very powerful unit testing framework for C++. Lastly, the building step, which equals to compilation in C/C++. Suitable build tool depends on a lot of the target platform. The target platform has many variables, starting from the targeted OS and going down to processor architectures (e.g., x86 and ARM) and even specific instruction sets (e.g., AVX2 for vector instructions). For Windows development the de facto is Visual Studio’s MSVC compiler. The two most popular general compilers are GCC and the LLVM based Clang, which can be used to target to multiple different platforms. For highly optimized and parallelized builds Intel’s C++ compiler might be the preferred choice, though it is not open source nor free.

There exists a huge pool of alternatives to Jenkins and GitHub actions. Some notable are such as GitLab’s CI system, TeamCity, Travis CI and Buildbot.

For this scenario, I would maybe go with some cloud-based CI environment, given the low number of people working on the project. Also, cloud-based environments are more hassle free than self-hosted system, so it leaves more development time for the small team.
